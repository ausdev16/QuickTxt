# QuickTxt

QuickTxt is a fast, free, Notepad alternative with legacy Code Pages support.

It is released under the BSD license.

It started as a way to learn C# / UWP.

Later, I ended up adding extensive legacy Code Pages support which added a lot of code. I did this for two reasons:

1) To open "Box ASCII Art" files.
2) International text file support for files that use legacy Code Pages rather than UTF.

Feel free contintrube in any way!
